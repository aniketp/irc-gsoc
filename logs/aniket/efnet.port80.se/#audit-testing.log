[2018-04-24 22:58:37] <aniketp41> Hi Alan, am I supposed to get an email with FreeBSD for mailing list communication? The page here mentioned setting up the Project Wiki and Self page along with FreeBSD email address. https://wiki.freebsd.org/SummerOfCodeStudentChecklist

[2018-04-25 19:22:29] <aniketp41> ping @somers__ 
[2018-04-25 19:24:26] <somers__> I don't know what you're "supposed" to get
[2018-04-25 19:24:29] <somers__> what are you expecting?
[2018-04-25 19:25:09] <somers__> BTW aniketp41, if you want to get my attention on IRC, you should mention my nick.  I sit in some high traffic rooms, so my client doesn't alert me unless my nick gets mentioned
[2018-04-25 20:25:21] <aniketp41> somers__ The checklist page mentioned about a username for SVN SummerOfCode repository which would also be used as the email, so I wonmdered if is it provided or would I need to create one for myself?
[2018-04-25 20:25:21] <aniketp41> Also, I have created a WikiPage "AniketPandey" and the page says to ask a FreeBSD developer to include my account in the Contributer's Group. So I was wondering if you could do that..
[2018-04-25 21:48:42] <aniketp41> ping somers__
[2018-04-25 22:02:48] <somers__> Ahh, to get your SVN account you'll have to email soc-admins@freebsd.org, as detailed at https://wiki.freebsd.org/SummerOfCodeSubversion
[2018-04-25 22:03:21] <somers__> Tell them you'll need a branch of the src tree
[2018-04-25 22:05:07] <somers__> Where is your "AniketPandey" wiki page?  I can't find it.
[2018-04-25 22:06:20] <aniketp41> Oh, guess it isn't created yet. I created my account but I can't create my page as I don't have the edit access.
[2018-04-25 22:08:40] <somers__> Ok, try again
[2018-04-25 22:32:33] <aniketp41> Thanks somers__ ! I created a basic page and would keep it updated throughout the project
[2018-04-25 22:32:33] <aniketp41> https://wiki.freebsd.org/AniketPandey
[2018-04-25 22:43:28] <aniketp41> Btw @somers__ , Would you advise on testing auditdistd(8) as well? A contributer Mateusz Piotrowski emailed me asking about it.
[2018-04-26 03:11:32] <somers__> aniketp41 I would consider auditdistd to be a stretch goal.  Testing the auditing itself is more important.

[2018-04-27 00:40:28] <aniketp41> Hi @somers_, Does your work at Spectra involve FreeBSD? I was just curious. As I've noticed that quite a few FreeBSD devs contribute to it as a part-time hobby, while others use it at work.

[2018-04-29 13:36:29] <aniketp41> Hi @somers_, I mailed the soc-admins about getting a subversion account and a branch in socsvn repository. Also, my semester exams ended today so I'll regularly update you on my work from now on

[2018-04-29 14:04:21] <somers_> cool
[2018-04-29 14:47:36] <aniketp41> Btw @somers_, how much time does it take to "buildworld" the freebsd kernel by a single job? I was trying to build my tests by compiling the "/usr/src" and its been running for the last 10 minutes..
[2018-04-29 14:48:25] <aniketp41> Although I later realized that the guide here https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/makeworld.html recommended four jobs (-j4)
[2018-04-29 14:48:38] <somers_> Depends on what kind of machine you have.  "buildworld" can take anywhere from 10 minutes to 2.5 hours on typical hardware
[2018-04-29 14:49:00] <somers_> But once you've built it once, you can do "make -DNO_CLEAN buildworld" on subsequent invocations
[2018-04-29 14:51:30] <somers_> The number of jobs should be at least equal to the number of CPU cores.  If you're I/O is slow, then use up to 2x number of cores for your job number
[2018-04-29 14:51:33] <aniketp41> I created a separate VM for specifically this task and it does not have very good specs. so by what you said it might take a long time
[2018-04-29 14:51:39] <somers_> Is your source directory mounted over NFS?
[2018-04-29 14:52:46] <aniketp41> No it is simple UFS
[2018-04-29 14:53:24] <somers_> Ok, that's fine then.  Just give your VM as much CPU and RAM as you can, set the jobs number appropriately, and wait.
[2018-04-29 15:04:37] <aniketp41> Wow, it's building quite fast, my main machine had 8 cores and 16 gigs of ram which allowed me to allocate 4 cores and about 10 gigs to my VM. With 8 jobs it's doing well!
[2018-04-29 15:05:04] <somers_> cool!  What kind of storage does it have?
[2018-04-29 15:09:43] <aniketp41> I think its HDD, although the Virtualbox showed an option to have an SSD partition
[2018-04-29 15:10:07] <somers_> What's important is the physical device, not how VirtualBox displays it
[2018-04-29 15:10:20] <aniketp41> Though my main machine has 256 gigs SSD
[2018-04-29 15:10:52] <somers_> If you have SSD storage and 4 cores, then 8 build jobs is too many.  Just use 5-6
[2018-04-29 15:15:56] <aniketp41> Okay, I'll keep it in mind the next time I try building the kernel
[2018-04-29 15:53:04] <aniketp41> So it took 46 minutes approx to buildworld. Now doing buildkernel with 6 jobs now
[2018-04-30 00:36:54] <aniketp41> Hi @somers_, I was reading about non-blocking sockets for testing network APIs as you suggested in a previous mail. But I couldn't come up with any idea about how this would help me in writing the test program. For instance, to have all system calls in one place, I'll need to have both client and server running in the single program, but how would using non-blocking socket help me? AFAIK it would just prevent accept(2), recv(2) from blocking the connection. 
[2018-04-30 00:42:38] <aniketp41> I also had another idea about the approach that I might follow. Till now I've been testing the file-create/read audit_events independently, so what if I use the same approach for network system calls that don't need a client (or a server, the other way), like socket(2), bind(2), setsockopt(2), listen(2) etc. Once I've confirmed their audit, I can simply close the socket as I don't really need a connection here.
[2018-04-30 00:42:38] <aniketp41> As for syscalls like accept(2), connect(2), send(2), recv(2) etc, that need a connection, I can have a separate binary which I can execute using system(3) and them call the syscall from my kyua test-case, and finally poll into auditpipe(4) to check if that particular syscall is audited or not? This approach is a bit weird since I will need external socket-programs, but might actually work! Please provide your inputs for this..
