[2018-04-26 07:58:14] <engblom> I just installed freebsd and I install hs-xmonad and firefox. When trying to launch firefox, it is just dumping core
[2018-04-26 07:58:41] <engblom> Is the firefox package broken, or do I need to do something extra in order to get firefox working?

[2018-04-26 08:03:31] <wowas> i copied a FreeBSD Host with dd to another host. When it now boots up it always runs into sysinstall
[2018-04-26 08:04:03] <wowas> is this because the diskname changed from da0 to ad0?
[2018-04-26 08:04:06] <dh> engblom: And you could use truss to see how far firefox manages to run before crashing
[2018-04-26 08:04:29] <stl> engblom: starting firefox from the terminal may also give you some clues
[2018-04-26 08:06:00] <engblom> It is complaining about a missing /etc/machine-id
[2018-04-26 08:07:49] <dh> Ignore that
[2018-04-26 08:09:34] <engblom> This was the problem. I created one with a 32 character long string of '1'

[2018-04-26 16:56:30] <qbsd> unlike linux, which is just a kernel that 'distro' builders add the gnu userland to in order to create a 'distro' - freebsd is a complete OS which includes its own userland. buildworld compiles this userland from source
[2018-04-26 16:57:04] <VoidChicken> iirc buildworld also builds some things that buildkernel needs
[2018-04-26 16:57:33] <bipul> You mean i 'm building OS inside /usr/src ?
[2018-04-26 16:57:39] <VoidChicken> yup
[2018-04-26 16:58:26] <bipul> So how buildworld is different from buildkerenl?

[2018-04-26 17:03:32] <qbsd> the first part of a buildworld actually bootstrap builds the system compiler, which then is used to build the rest of the system iirc
[2018-04-26 17:03:49] <dh> Sure there's a limit on number of jails, but I haven't reached it.. I've ran thousands of jails at the same time
[2018-04-26 17:04:35] <bipul> dh, and each jail uses there own kernel? right?
[2018-04-26 17:04:49] <dh> No
[2018-04-26 17:04:58] <qbsd> jails are a 'super-duper' form ala chroot and run in the same kernel as the OS on the machine; with virtualization each virtual instance each runs its own kernel
[2018-04-26 17:05:02] <dh> They share the same (host system) kernel
[2018-04-26 17:05:12] <bipul> Then it's like docker?

[2018-04-26 17:06:43] <ptek> dh, I wondered this thing for a long time - freebsd has this awesome thing called jails since such a long time
[2018-04-26 17:07:02] <ptek> is it possible to declare what jail should be upfront?
[2018-04-26 17:07:15] <ptek> by declare, I mean define it with code
[2018-04-26 17:07:35] <dh> I don't understand the question
[2018-04-26 17:07:42] <ptek> bash script would be fine, but I wonder if there is a better and a more declarative way of doing this
[2018-04-26 17:08:17] <ptek> Well, with docker, one creates an "Image" that one can run later in a different environment
[2018-04-26 17:08:25] <dh> Do you want something like Dockerfile (or what was that thing), except for FreeBSD jails?

[2018-04-26 17:09:17] <ptek> the whole benefit of docker, in my opinion, is that you can declare what it is in the development environment, freeze it, test it, and then run in production somewhere else
[2018-04-26 17:10:10] <ptek> I came across ezjail that says it can work with images, but I could not find out more
[2018-04-26 17:10:23] <bipul> ptek, Yes the docker creates a container i.e chroot environment.
[2018-04-26 17:10:31] <dh> There isn't anything that works just like docker, all the tools are there, but you have to do the work yourself
[2018-04-26 17:10:40] <ptek> dh, I see
[2018-04-26 17:10:44] <bipul> You can run your specific application into those environment.
[2018-04-26 17:11:52] <dh> Like you can use iocage to create jails, make them into a template and then re-use that template to create new jails, there's also plugin system and perhaps even way to distribute the templates (I haven't checked)
[2018-04-26 17:12:16] <ptek> this is interesting, thanks
[2018-04-26 17:12:21] <ptek> will have to look into that

[2018-04-26 17:31:06] <shbrngdo> this is why I object to 'new, shiny' when it's a solution looking for a problem
[2018-04-26 17:31:39] <dstolfa> shbrngdo: here's one for you: you have arbitrary versions of FreeBSD machines using both 11 and 12, netbooted across a cluster and you want to minimise the amount of things you generate on a central machine that netboots, and instead install it automatically locally on the disk and generate services on it, such as a preconfigured nginx/database environment in separate jails. i'll be here watching you cry.
[2018-04-26 17:31:43] <shbrngdo> this goes double when it was apparently written by someone that learned to code in Java first
[2018-04-26 17:32:30] <dstolfa> the amount of stupid hacks i had to do to get something like this working simply because rc sucks is scary. the hacks are also scary because they don't actually work and can be racy.

[2018-04-26 17:35:05] <dstolfa> the point is

[2018-04-26 17:35:32] <shbrngdo> sounds like systemd to me
[2018-04-26 17:35:35] <dstolfa> you don't even notice what init you're running, you notice it's interface and i don't see why it can't be done in a backwards compatible way that works much better under the hood

[2018-04-26 17:36:03] <dstolfa> i don't see why we couldn't have /etc/rc.conf that looks exactly as it does now, but with the option of specifying additional things such as dependencies between services and their properties
[2018-04-26 17:36:06] <shbrngdo> so "streamlining" isn't "re-writing".  if you want to streamline it, that'd be different
[2018-04-26 17:36:20] <dstolfa> shbrngdo: it is re-writing because rc is written in a fundamentally flawed way for modern deployments
[2018-04-26 17:36:30] <shbrngdo> dstolfa the dependencies are actually there, as comments at the top of the rc script
[2018-04-26 17:36:38] <dstolfa> shbrngdo: that's not dependencies.
[2018-04-26 17:36:42] <shbrngdo> sure it is
[2018-04-26 17:36:53] <dstolfa> no, no it's really not.
[2018-04-26 17:37:35] <shbrngdo> see 'man rc' and the section "Contents of rc.d" where it goes into the various things like NETWORKING SERVERS etc.
[2018-04-26 17:37:47] <dstolfa> shbrngdo: please tell me how i can specify a dependency on my service getting *started* only if i have a jail providing a particular functionality?
[2018-04-26 17:38:52] <shbrngdo> the 'PROVIDE' 'REQUIRE' and 'BEFORE' elements are for that, as far as I know.  But if you need a jail to start up first, that should be doable
[2018-04-26 17:39:25] <dstolfa> shbrngdo: the bit you're missing is that you have to write a full script that does that, and now if you have a heterogeneous environment for many different functionalities, you have to have a bunch of overly complicated, probably buggy scripts
[2018-04-26 17:39:34] <dstolfa> that potentially race
[2018-04-26 17:39:39] <shbrngdo> 'rcorder' - that's what I was looking for
[2018-04-26 17:39:49] <debdrup> rcorder can't handle jails
[2018-04-26 17:40:07] <shbrngdo> right but it could handle jail startups
[2018-04-26 17:40:12] <dstolfa> shbrngdo: and then race.

[2018-04-26 17:40:36] <dstolfa> because you start up a jail and have your service depend on something in that jail being started, and rc decides oh, this is done! let me go off and start the service
[2018-04-26 17:40:47] <dstolfa> and suddenly you end up with either silent breakage that's a nightmare to debug or it just doesn't work
[2018-04-26 17:40:47] <shbrngdo> dstolfa - if you make the assumption that a race condition could potentially exist, what I'd do is 'daemon' the process and have it wait before starting the actual functionality
[2018-04-26 17:41:01] <dstolfa> shbrngdo: in which case you're worse than systemd is

[2018-04-26 17:42:36] <shbrngdo> well not so much that but if you must wait for networking to be set up before starting your server, that kind of thing.
[2018-04-26 17:43:19] <shbrngdo> dstolfa probably not with the specifics of what you're doing.  But I would most likely make it fault tolerant, forgiving, and allow things to restart themselves
[2018-04-26 17:43:31] <dstolfa> shbrngdo: sure you would, see you in a year
[2018-04-26 17:43:38] <dstolfa> once you've rewritten rc to be more like systemd/launchd
[2018-04-26 17:43:41] <debdrup> allowing things to restart themselves is a bad idea
[2018-04-26 17:44:05] <shbrngdo> example:  I set up a simple daemon process that checks to see that my 'ppp' connection is up and running.  If the DNS isn't properly bound to the (fixed) IP address, I restart named
[2018-04-26 17:44:33] <dstolfa> shbrngdo: please do that for over 100 services on over 300 machines and tell me how well it works :)
[2018-04-26 17:44:37] <shbrngdo> this is because during server startup ppp may not actually connect.  But when it does, named may already be running [and i need it running whether or not ppp connects]
[2018-04-26 17:45:06] <shbrngdo> dstolfa - I don't have a need to do that.  In fact, I question having the need to do that.  It sounds like time for a system design review
[2018-04-26 17:45:15] <debdrup> shbrngdo: if ppp doesn't connect then you need to fix that issue, rather than restarting something else
[2018-04-26 17:45:30] <debdrup> you're treating the symptom, not the disease
[2018-04-26 17:45:34] <shbrngdo> debdrup - this is not an option in my case.
[2018-04-26 17:45:47] <debdrup> shbrngdo: sorry, but I very much doubt that..
[2018-04-26 17:45:49] <dstolfa> shbrngdo: if you question the need for having to do that, why don't you go and explain that to every big & successful software company ever, and anyone ever doing distributed systems research?
[2018-04-26 17:46:00] <shbrngdo> the disease is that I have an unreliable connection because I cannot AFFORD a better one.  Give me money, problem solved.
[2018-04-26 17:46:53] <debdrup> shbrngdo: it can be solved with something as simple as a set of timeouts to ensure that ppp blocks until a connection is guarenteed if time is not of the essense.
[2018-04-26 17:47:01] <dstolfa> debdrup: or you know, RPC

[2018-04-26 17:47:42] <dstolfa> debdrup: the only thing that knows if a connection is successful is the thing opening it. it can then issue a message to the other process saying look, i did it, please go off and do the thing you wanted to do

[2018-04-26 17:54:45] <xinobi> can i create an alias within hosts file?
[2018-04-26 17:54:47] <shbrngdo> so you'd configure routing on the box that has the lo0 alias with 192.168.2.1 (for example).  As long as the primary gateway knows about the route, it should send packets to your box when other things on the net need it

[2018-04-26 18:08:37] <shbrngdo> that's the ideal way to do it, yeah.
[2018-04-26 18:09:05] <shbrngdo> with a connection that fast they cuold have you use PPPoE and not really affect your speed
[2018-04-26 18:09:22] <debdrup> what?
[2018-04-26 18:09:28] <shbrngdo> it makes routing on their end a little simpler, preserves use of IPv4 addresses (no /30 blocks)
[2018-04-26 18:09:52] <shbrngdo> and PPPoE apparently has an ipv6 capability, though my ISP doesn't assign anything.
[2018-04-26 18:10:05] <debdrup> if they did use pppoe it'd be slower unless they had hardware offloading for it
[2018-04-26 18:10:36] <shbrngdo> well that's my point - PPPoE adds some protocol overhead [of course] but 'hardware offloading' would be the key
[2018-04-26 18:11:03] <debdrup> why do you think mpd exists on freebsd, to take advantage of netgraph so that it's faster than it would be in userspace

[2018-04-26 18:11:42] <shbrngdo> mpd?  haven't used it... [looking in man page]
[2018-04-26 18:13:33] <shbrngdo> hmmm... no reference to 'mpd' in 11 or 12, no relevant source file in 12 that has 'mpd' in its name...
[2018-04-26 18:13:38] <shbrngdo> is it a port?

[2018-04-26 18:16:47] <debdrup> protip: don't be like me, type out sentences in full.
[2018-04-26 18:16:47] <shbrngdo> that makes sense, otherwise you'd need a kernel module
[2018-04-26 18:17:46] <shbrngdo> it's not like a kernel module is that big of a deal, but then it becomes very system-specific so having something in base (netgraph) helps a LOT
[2018-04-26 18:19:20] <debdrup> there's ng_ipacct which is useful in conjunction with mpd, but that's it

[2018-05-23 13:29:21] <shbrngdo> heh - yeah the first one scans the drive, then the smartctl might show something wrong with it.  it won't detect problems on blocks you haven't read, as far as I know
[2018-05-23 13:29:34] <Darkclaw> shbrngdo, ahhhh that makes sense
[2018-05-23 13:30:27] <shbrngdo> usually incorrect block count is fixed with fsck -y though... [but I've noticed you might have to run it more than once].  Usually THAT is caused by not shutting down properly
[2018-05-23 13:30:44] <shbrngdo> so if you power off before you see the "it is safe to power off" on the console - that'll cause it
[2018-05-23 13:31:13] <Darkclaw> I must have done it at least 5 times and it gave me the impression that it fixed it but then when I boot into multi user mode those errorws come back

[2018-05-23 13:31:56] <CrtxReavr> You have some different sata cables and/or ports you could try?

[2018-05-23 13:32:53] <Darkclaw> I can try using a different port and sata cable
[2018-05-23 13:33:02] <Darkclaw> should I do it after the dd step?

[2018-05-23 13:33:09] <shbrngdo> I had a drive that was going bad on me last year, had ZFS on it.  kept reporting more errors, but it wasn't because the data was corrupt on the drive, it appeared to be errors due to failing electronics on the drive itself
[2018-05-23 13:33:30] <shbrngdo> that actually made it a bit "easier" to extract the data off of it
[2018-05-23 13:34:37] <shbrngdo> eventually I couldn't even mount the thing to read the data [I'd get kernel panics and stuff like that from the ZFS info being corrupted]
[2018-05-23 13:34:50] <Darkclaw> fortunately this is a HD that just has the OS on it
[2018-05-23 13:35:03] <shbrngdo> what file system by the way... ?
[2018-05-23 13:35:09] <Darkclaw> should be UFS
[2018-05-23 13:35:09] <shbrngdo> [I am assuming UFS+J]
[2018-05-23 13:35:31] <shbrngdo> also that build error you were having - how old is your ports collection?
[2018-05-23 13:36:40] <Darkclaw> I ran a portupgrade before building and it had many ports outdated. Many of them errored out because of failed dependencies. when I check the failed dependencies, it wasn't really giving an intuitive reason. just some stuff like ../../include/QtCore/../../src/corelib/thread/qthread.h:162:5: error: division by zero in preprocessor expression
[2018-05-23 13:37:22] <shbrngdo> ok I'm assuming it's not the 'portupgrade' package but an update to the ports tree (via portsnap) ?
[2018-05-23 13:37:39] <Darkclaw> ahhh yes it's probably portsnap
[2018-05-23 13:37:51] <Darkclaw> I just run this script that does it, I forgot
[2018-05-23 13:37:56] <shbrngdo> as I recall portsnap grabs 'head' [and takes forever] which is less than ideal.  you might try a quarterly snapshot via svn
[2018-05-23 13:38:14] <Darkclaw> I did rm -rf /usr/ports and downloaded the latest ports
[2018-05-23 13:39:33] * AikiZen (~AikiZen@68.85.136.77.rev.sfr.net) join
[2018-05-23 13:39:53] <Darkclaw> it looks like fsck is done, it says file system is clean. that's BS
[2018-05-23 13:39:54] <shbrngdo> If you wanted to get the Q2 snapshot you could try this:  rm -rf /usr/ports ; mkdir /usr/ports ; cd /usr/ports ; svnlight checkout https://svn.freebsd.org/ports/branches/2018Q2   <-- I think that's right
[2018-05-23 13:40:26] <shbrngdo> that way you'd be getting the snapshot for the Q2 packages.  I _think_ this is more reliable than guessing "the last port maintainer" didn't screw up the build on ya
[2018-05-23 13:41:09] <shbrngdo> I've had SO many problems with 'head' on ports I don't even update them any more except right after a release.  I haven't testd it yet, but I think the quarterly snapshots will be less likely to build-fail like that
[2018-05-23 13:41:26] <Darkclaw> the thing is, many other ports that are not QT or KDE related are giving those kinds of errors too
[2018-05-23 13:41:50] <shbrngdo> divide by zero in the preprocessor also might be due to something in make.conf (in theory anyway)
[2018-05-23 13:42:02] <shbrngdo> or it could be due to a problem with clang
[2018-05-23 13:42:46] <shbrngdo> but you're using 11.1 so it's not -CURRENT which tends to rule out clang problems [unless bad hard drive, corrupted lib or something]
[2018-05-23 13:43:14] <Darkclaw> I'll try all of the above, it doesn't look like fsck is not quite done yet
[2018-05-23 13:44:47] <shbrngdo> yeah let it fix stuff.  But if your kernel+world is hosed, the only way _I_ know of to fix it is to re-build kernel+world and install it with 'make installkernel' and 'make installworld'
[2018-05-23 13:45:07] <shbrngdo> I don't know of an easy way to re-install using binaries

[2018-05-23 15:48:12] <shbrngdo> you can try installing it manually
[2018-05-23 15:48:28] <shbrngdo> or maybe you need to build it from ports
[2018-05-23 15:48:30] <drougge> Ah, it actually says so ("pkg: mencoder has a missing dependency: lame") when installing, it's just that there's so much output. It could have been more prominently displayed (and not scolled of screen as it was).
[2018-05-23 15:48:47] <drougge> So yeah, build from ports it is I guess.
[2018-05-23 15:49:11] <shbrngdo> the problem with things LIKE 'lame' is that it [allegedly] violates patents and so they won't distribute binaries.  probably.
[2018-05-23 15:49:37] <shbrngdo> I've seen similar things before with mp4 encoding and whatnot.  decoding seems to be 'ok', encoding not so much.
[2018-05-23 15:50:06] <drougge> I'd say the problem is pkg doesn't scream and shout and require --yes-I-know-it-wont-work flags or something, lame not having a package is a secondary problem.
